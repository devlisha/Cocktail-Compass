## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep plum (#483183) for a sophisticated and inviting feel, evocative of fine liquors.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA) creates a soft and elegant backdrop that complements the plum without overpowering it. It's desaturated to ensure legibility and calm the design.
- Accent color: Amber gold (#FFBF00) for highlighting interactive elements and important information, like the daily cocktail suggestion. It draws the eye and suggests the warmth of a well-crafted drink.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif. Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. The high contrast of Playfair evokes a high-end cocktail bar, and PT Sans creates great readability.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons to represent cocktail ingredients and categories.
- Card-based layout for recipes to ensure easy browsing and a visually appealing experience.
- Subtle transitions and animations on user interactions (e.g., favoriting a recipe) to enhance engagement.
